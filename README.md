Task1. Object Oriented Programming
--------------------------------------------------------------
It is necessary to write an object-oriented application according to the requirements given below. 
The application must implement the functionality defined by the individual task.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements:

⦁ When implementing the inheritance hierarchy, the derived class must extend the superclass with new properties, for which it is necessary to understand the subject area of ​​the problem.

⦁ Entity classes should not be overloaded (excessive writing) with methods that perform functional actions (business logic methods such as search, etc.).

⦁ For entity classes, you should (when necessary) override the methods of the Object class: toString(), equals(), hashCode().

⦁ To sort objects, use the implementation of the Comparator interface.

⦁ When solving a problem, you can use Creator, Builder, Factory Method patterns.

⦁ All application classes must be packaged.

⦁ When handling exceptions, the application must use a logger.

⦁ Code formatting must comply with the Java Code Convention.

⦁ The parameters required to create objects must be entered by the user. User input can be organized as reading data from a file (.txt, .xml, .json), or using "hardcode".

⦁ Do not implement a custom menu for the application.
